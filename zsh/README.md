# README / ZSH

Sourcing the `zsh/boostrap.zsh` file will overwrite your current `.zshrc` file.

Placing any `.zsh` file into the `/zsh/lib` folder will cause it to be added to the list of sources on the newly generated `.zshrc`.

After making any changes, run `>$ init` to run this script and reload the session.
